A picture is worth a thousand words.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Fortune favors the bold.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Practice makes perfect.
Two heads are better than one.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
A watched pot never boils.
Birds of a feather flock together.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
All that glitters is not gold.
The early bird catches the worm.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Actions speak louder than words.
Better late than never.
